## Overview

Open Weather is a simple Minecraft mod aiming to add realtime weather to your Minecraft worlds, by using public available weather APIs.

### Why does this exist?

To be honest, everytime I try to get into Minecraft modding I find myself just copying the tutorial I am following. So... to break from the habit I've tried make a goal of making a simple standalone mod with a clear goal. Additionally, by putting this on GitHub allows me to practice contributing to thew Open Source community.
